# 📝 [Problem #289: Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/)  

**🎯 Task**:  
Given an `m x n` grid representing the state of cells as live (`1`) or dead (`0`), simulate one step of the "Game of Life" based on the following rules:  
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.  
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).  

Update the grid **in-place**, without using extra space for another board.

## 🌟 Solution: In-Place State Encoding  

### Approach:  
1. 🔄 **Iterate through the board**:  
   - Use a `directions` list to represent all possible neighbor cells (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).  
   - For each cell, count live neighbors.  
2. 🟦 **State transition using temporary markers**:  
   - Mark cells transitioning from live (`1`) to dead (`0`) as `-1`.  
   - Mark cells transitioning from dead (`0`) to live (`1`) as `2`.  
3. 🔄 **Final state update**:  
   - Replace all `-1` with `0` and all `2` with `1`.  
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the board.  
5. 🔗 **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since the board is updated in-place.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        # Directions for the 8 neighbors
        directions = [
            (1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, -1),
            (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)
        ]

        # First pass: Update the board with temporary markers
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                live_neighbors = 0
                for x, y in directions:
                    if (0 <= i + x < len(board)) and (0 <= j + y < len(board[0])) and abs(board[i + x][j + y]) == 1:
                        live_neighbors += 1

                # Apply the rules
                if board[i][j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):  # Rule 1 or 3
                    board[i][j] = -1  # Mark as dead
                if board[i][j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:  # Rule 4
                    board[i][j] = 2  # Mark as live

        # Second pass: Finalize the state
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                board[i][j] = 1 if board[i][j] > 0 else 0
