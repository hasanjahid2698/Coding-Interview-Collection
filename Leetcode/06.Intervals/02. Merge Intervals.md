# 📝 [Problem #56: Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting non-overlapping intervals.

---

## 🌟 Solution: Sorting and Merging Intervals  

### Approach:  
1. 🗂️ **Sort Intervals**:  
   - Sort the intervals by their starting point. This ensures overlapping intervals are adjacent.

2. 🔄 **Iterate Through Intervals**:  
   - For each interval:  
     - ✅ If it does not overlap with the last interval in the result, add it to the result.  
     - ➕ If it overlaps, merge it with the last interval by updating the end time to the maximum of both intervals.  

4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting the intervals, where \(n\) is the number of intervals.  
5. 🔗 **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the resulting merged intervals.

## ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Sort intervals by start time
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        ans = []  # List to store merged intervals
        
        for interval in intervals:
            # If no overlap, add interval to the result
            if not ans or ans[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                ans.append(interval)
            else:
                # Merge intervals by updating the end time
                ans[-1][1] = max(ans[-1][1], interval[1])
        
        return ans
```
