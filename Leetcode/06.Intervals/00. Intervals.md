# 📝 Generic Solution for Interval Problems

**🎯 Task**:  
Solve problems involving intervals, such as merging overlapping intervals, inserting new intervals, or determining minimum resources (e.g., arrows, rooms, etc.) required to process all intervals.  

---

## 🌟 Generic Approach:  

### 🗂️ **1. Sort the Intervals**:  
- Always begin by sorting the intervals based on their start points or end points, depending on the problem requirements.  
  ```python
  intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Example: Sort by start point
  ```

### ➡️ **2. Iterate Through Intervals**:  
- Use a loop to process the sorted intervals one by one.  

### 🤝 **3. Handle Overlap or Merge Logic**:  
- **For Merging Problems**:  
  - Use a result list to store non-overlapping intervals.  
  - Check if the current interval overlaps with the last interval in the result list. If yes, merge them; otherwise, add the current interval to the result.  
    ```python
    if result[-1][1] >= interval[0]:  # Overlap detected
        result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], interval[1])  # Merge
    else:
        result.append(interval)  # No overlap, add to result
    ```

- **For Resource Allocation Problems** (e.g., arrows, rooms):  
  - Track key metrics like the end of the last processed interval or ongoing intervals.  
  - Increment counters as necessary when new intervals start or resources are needed.  
    ```python
    if current_start > last_end:
        count += 1  # New resource needed
        last_end = current_end  # Update the reference
    ```

### 🔄 **4. Return the Result**:  
- After processing all intervals, return the updated list, count, or other required output.

### ⏱️ **Complexity**:  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(nlog n)\) for sorting, plus \(O(n)\) for iteration — overall \(O(nlog n)\).  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for in-place updates or \(O(n)\) if a new data structure is used.

## ✨ Template Implementation:  

```python
def solveIntervalProblem(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> Any:
    # Step 1: Sort intervals by start point
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Step 2: Initialize necessary data structures
    result = []  # To store the merged intervals (or other outputs)
    count = 0    # For problems requiring a counter (e.g., resources like arrows)

    # Step 3: Process each interval
    for interval in intervals:
        # Example: Merge overlapping intervals
        if result and result[-1][1] >= interval[0]:
            result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], interval[1])  # Merge intervals
        else:
            result.append(interval)

        # Example: Resource allocation logic
        if result[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            count += 1
            result.append(interval)

    # Step 4: Return appropriate result
    return result  # Replace with count or other required output
```

## 💡 Use Cases:  
1. **Merge Intervals**: Combine overlapping intervals.  
2. **Insert Interval**: Insert and merge a new interval.  
3. **Minimum Resources**: Calculate minimum arrows, meeting rooms, or other resources.  
4. **Interval Coverage**: Determine if all intervals can be covered or processed with specific constraints.  
5. **Non-Overlapping Intervals**: Count or return non-overlapping intervals.  

Adjust the logic in **Step 3** based on the specific problem!
