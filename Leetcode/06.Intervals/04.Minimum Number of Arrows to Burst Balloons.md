# 📝 [Problem #452: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Given a 2D array of intervals representing balloon diameters, determine the minimum number of vertical arrows required to burst all balloons. An arrow at position \(x\) bursts all balloons with xstart <= x <= xend.

## 🌟 Solution: Greedy Overlap Merging  

### Approach:  
1. 🗂️ **Sort by End Points**:  
   - Sort the intervals by their ending points to ensure that we burst as many balloons as possible with one arrow.  

2. ➡️ **Iterate Through Intervals**:  
   - Maintain a variable `max_end` to track the end of the last burst balloon.  
   - For each interval:  
     - If the current balloon’s `start` is greater than `max_end`, it means a new arrow is needed.  
     - Update `max_end` to the current balloon’s `end`.  

3. 🔄 **Update Arrow Count**:  
   - Increment the arrow count whenever a new arrow is required.  

4. ⏱️ **Complexity**:  
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting the intervals.  
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for sort.

## ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        result, max_end = 0, -math.inf
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end point
        
        for start, end in points:
            # If the current balloon starts after the last burst end, a new arrow is needed
            if max_end < start:
                result += 1
                max_end = end  # Update the maximum end for overlapping balloons
                
        return result
```
