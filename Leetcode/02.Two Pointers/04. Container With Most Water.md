# 📝 [Problem #11: Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

**🎯 Task**: You are given an integer array `height` of length ( n ). There are ( n ) vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ( ith ) line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## 🌟 Solution:

1. ⚡ Initialize two pointers:
    - `i` pointing to the beginning of the array.
    - `j` pointing to the end of the array.
2. 🔁 While `i < j`:
    - Compute the area of the container using the formula:
      
      `area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)`
      
    - Update the `maxarea` with the maximum of `maxarea` and the calculated area.
    - Adjust the pointers:
        - If `height[i] < height[j]`, increment `i`.
        - Otherwise, decrement `j`.
3. ✅ Return `maxarea` after the loop ends.
5. 📌 **Note**: As we are using min height, only max of current two pointers can provide better answer
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### ✨ Solution: Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxarea = -1
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        while i < j:
            # Calculate the current area
            ar = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)
            # Update the maximum area
            maxarea = max(ar, maxarea)
            # Move the pointer associated with the bigger height
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return maxarea
