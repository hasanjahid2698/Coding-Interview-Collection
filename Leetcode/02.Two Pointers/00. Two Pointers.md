# ✨ Two Pointers Approach 

In Two Pointers approach:

1. 🟢 Start with two pointers at two positions (typically at opposite corners of an array or range).  
2. ⚡At each step:
   - 🔍 Check if the current configuration satisfies the condition for the answer.
   - 🔄 If not, adjust the pointers to minimize the range:
     - ➡️ Increase the **left pointer** or  
     - ⬅️ Decrease the **right pointer**.
3. 🔁 Continue this process until the two pointers meet or cross each other.
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: Typically **O(n)** for linear traversal.
