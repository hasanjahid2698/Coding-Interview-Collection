# 📝 [Problem #125: Valid Palindrome]([https://](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150))


**🎯Task**: find valid palindrome after Removing of all non-alphanumerie Characters

---

## 🌟 Solution:

1. ⚡ Initialize l and r as the left and right pointers.
2. 🔁 While l is less than r:
    - ➡️ Increment l until it points to an alphanumeric character.
    - ⬅️ Decrement r until it points to an alphanumeric character.
    - If l becomes greater than r, return True as the string is a palindrome.
    - 🔍 Compare characters at l and r (case-insensitive):
        - If they are not equal, return False as the string is not a palindrome.
        - If they are equal, increment l and decrement r.
3. ✅ Return True if the loop completes without finding any mismatch.
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### ✨ Solution 1: Two Pointers 
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1
        
        while l < r:
            # Move left pointer to next alphanumeric
            while l < r and not s[l].isalnum(): 
                l += 1
            # Move right pointer to previous alphanumeric
            while r > l and not s[r].isalnum(): 
                r -= 1
            # Check mismatch
            if l > r or s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            # Move pointers closer
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return True
```
### ✨ Solution 2: Simple Two-Liner
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]
        return s == s[::-1]
