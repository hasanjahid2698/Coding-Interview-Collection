# 📝 [Problem #392: Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/)

**🎯 Task**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

## 🌟 Solution:

1. ⚡ Initialize two pointers, `si` for the string `s` and `it` for string `t`.
2. 🔁 Loop through each character in `t`:
    - If `si` equals the length of `s`
        - return `True` as all characters of `s` have been matched.
    - If the current character in `t` matches the character at `si` in `s`, 
        - increment `si`.
3. ✅ If the loop completes without finding all characters of `s`, 
    - return `False`.
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of string `t`.

### ✨ Solution: Iterating Through t

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sl = len(s)
        tl = len(t)
        si = 0
        for it in range(tl + 1):
            # If all characters in s have been matched
            if si == sl:
                return True
            # If characters in s and t match, move to the next character in s
            elif it < tl and t[it] == s[si]:
                si += 1
        return False
```
