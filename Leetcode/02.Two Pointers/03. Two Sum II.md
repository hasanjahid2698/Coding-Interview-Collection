# 📝 [Problem #167: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

**🎯 Task**: Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

## 🌟 Solution:

1. ⚡ Initialize two pointers: 
    - `l` pointing to the beginning of the array.
    - `r` pointing to the end of the array.
2. 🔁 While `l < r`:
    - Compute the current sum `curSum` as `numbers[l] + numbers[r]`.
    - If `curSum` is greater than the `target`, decrement the right pointer `r`.
    - If `curSum` is less than the `target`, increment the left pointer `l`.
    - If `curSum` equals the `target`, return `[l+1, r+1]` as the solution (1-indexed).
3. ✅ If no solution is found by the end of the loop, return an empty array `[]`.
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input array.

### ✨ Solution: Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        while l < r:
            curSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            
            # Adjust pointers based on comparison with target
            if curSum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif curSum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]  # Return 1-indexed result
        return []
