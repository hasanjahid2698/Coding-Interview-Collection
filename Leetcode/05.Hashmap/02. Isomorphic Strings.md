# 📝 [Problem #205: Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Determine if two strings `s` and `t` are **isomorphic**.  

Two strings are isomorphic if:  
- Characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.  
- Each character in `s` maps uniquely to a character in `t`.  

---

## 🌟 Solution: Hash Map for Character Mapping  

### Approach:  
1. 🔄 Iterate over both strings simultaneously using `zip(s, t)`.  
2. 🗺️ Use a hash map to store the mapping of characters from `s` to `t`.  
3. ⚡ Check two conditions:  
   - If `s[i]` is already mapped to a character, ensure it matches `t[i]`.  
   - Prevent duplicate mappings by ensuring no character in `t` is already mapped.  
4. ✅ Return `True` if all conditions are met; otherwise, return `False`.  
5. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        hash_map = {}
        for c, ch in zip(s, t):  # Iterate over both strings simultaneously
            if c in hash_map:
                if hash_map[c] != ch:  # If the mapping is inconsistent
                    return False
            else:
                if ch in hash_map.values():  # Prevent duplicate mappings
                    return False
                hash_map[c] = ch
        return True
```
