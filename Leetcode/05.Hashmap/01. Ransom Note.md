# 📝 [Problem #383: Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, determine if `ransomNote` can be constructed using the letters from `magazine`. Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.  

---

## 🌟 Solution: Character Replacement  

### Approach:  
1. 🔍 Iterate through each character in `ransomNote`.  
2. ❌ If a character is not present in `magazine`, return `False`.  
3. 📝 If the character exists, remove its first occurrence in `magazine` to ensure it cannot be reused.  
4. ✅ Return `True` if all characters in `ransomNote` are accounted for.  
5. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n * m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `ransomNote` and \(m\) is the length of `magazine`.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        for char in ransomNote:
            if char not in magazine:
                return False
            # Remove the first occurrence of the character
            magazine = magazine.replace(char, '', 1)
        return True
```
