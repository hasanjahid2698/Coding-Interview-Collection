# 📝 [Problem #290: Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Determine if a string `s` follows the pattern `p`.  

**Follow** means:  
- There exists a bijection between letters in `p` and non-empty words in `s`.  
- Each letter in `p` maps to exactly one word in `s`.  
- Each word in `s` maps to exactly one letter in `p`.  

---

## 🌟 Solution: Hash Map for Bijective Mapping  

### Approach:  
1. 🔄 Split the string `s` into a list of words using `split(' ')`.  
2. 📏 Check for basic mismatches:  
   - The length of `p` and `words` must be equal.  
   - The number of unique letters in `p` must equal the number of unique words in `words`.  
3. 🗺️ Use a dictionary `w_to_p` to establish a mapping from words to pattern letters:  
   - If a word is not in `w_to_p`, map it to the current letter.  
   - If the word already has a mapping, ensure it matches the current letter.  
4. ✅ Return `False` for mismatches; otherwise, return `True`.  
5. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `p` or `words`.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, p: str, s: str) -> bool:
        words, w_to_p = s.split(' '), dict()

        # Check if the lengths of pattern and words mismatch
        if len(p) != len(words): 
            return False
        
        # Check for uniqueness mismatch between letters and words
        if len(set(p)) != len(set(words)): 
            return False

        # Map words to pattern letters
        for i in range(len(words)):
            if words[i] not in w_to_p: 
                w_to_p[words[i]] = p[i]
            elif w_to_p[words[i]] != p[i]: 
                return False

        return True
```
