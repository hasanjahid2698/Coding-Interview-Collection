# 📝 [Problem #202: Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is a **happy number**.  

A **happy number** is a number that eventually reaches `1` when replaced repeatedly by the sum of the squares of its digits. If the process results in a cycle that does not include `1`, the number is not happy.

## 🌟 Solution: Cycle Detection with a Set  

### Approach:  
1. 🗂️ Use a `set` to track numbers encountered during the process to detect cycles.  
2. 🔄 While \( n = 1 \):  
   - Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of \( n \).  
   - If \( n \) is already in the `set`, a cycle is detected. Return `False`.  
   - Otherwise, add \( n \) to the `set`.  
3. ✅ If the process reaches \( n = 1 \), return `True`.  
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(log n)\), as the sum of squares operation significantly reduces the size of the number.

## ✨ Python Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()

        while n != 1:
            n = sum(int(d) ** 2 for d in str(n))  # Compute the sum of squares of digits
            if n in seen:  # Detect a cycle
                return False
            seen.add(n)  # Add the current number to the set
        return True
```
