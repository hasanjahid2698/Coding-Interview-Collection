# 📝 Hashmap-Based Problems  

**🎯 Task**:  
Hashmap problems typically involve efficiently storing and retrieving key-value pairs to solve tasks like:
- Checking for duplicates.
- Tracking frequency or occurrences.
- Maintaining mappings between two entities.
- Handling prefix sums or cumulative sums.

## 🌟 General Approach for Hashmap Problems

### Steps to Solve:  
1. 🗂️ **Identify the Task**:  
   - Is it about tracking frequencies?  
   - Do you need to store indices or cumulative values?  
   - Are you maintaining mappings between two entities?

2. 🛠️ **Choose the Key and Value**:  
   - Decide what the `key` will represent (e.g., number, prefix sum, string).  
   - Determine the `value` (e.g., frequency, index, cumulative data).

3. 🔄 **Iterate Through the Input**:  
   - For each element in the input, check if the `key` exists in the hashmap.  
   - Perform the necessary operation (e.g., update frequency, calculate difference, or store a new value).

4. ✅ **Check Conditions**:  
   - Use the hashmap to quickly verify problem-specific conditions (e.g., index difference, prefix sum match).

5. 🔲 **Return Result**:  
   - After processing the input, return the required result based on the hashmap.

## ✨ Example Implementation  

### Problem:  
**Task**: Find if an array contains duplicate elements within a distance \(k\).

```python
def containsNearbyDuplicate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
    hashmap = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in hashmap:
            # Check if the difference in indices is within k
            if abs(hashmap[num] - i) <= k:
                return True
        # Update the hashmap with the current index
        hashmap[num] = i
    
    return False
```
