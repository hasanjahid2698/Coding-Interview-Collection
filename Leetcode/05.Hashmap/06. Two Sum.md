# 📝 [Problem #1: Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

## 🌟 Solution: Hash Map for Lookup  

### Approach:  
1. 🗂️ Use a dictionary `seen` to store numbers and their indices.  
2. 🔄 Iterate through the array `nums`:  
   - Compute the complement as  `target - nums[i]`.  
   - If the complement is already in `seen`, return the current index and the index of the complement.  
   - Otherwise, add the current number and its index to `seen`.  
3. ✅ Return the indices of the two numbers.  
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n) 
   - Each number is processed once, and dictionary lookups are O(1).

## ✨ Python Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, value in enumerate(nums):  # Iterate through the list
            remaining = target - nums[i]  # Calculate the complement
            
            if remaining in seen:  # Check if the complement exists in the dictionary
                return [i, seen[remaining]]  # Return the indices
            else:
                seen[value] = i  # Add the current number and its index to the dictionary
```
