# 📝 [Problem #242: Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

**🎯 Task**:  
Determine if string `t` is an **anagram** of string `s`.  

**Anagram Definition**:  
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies, but possibly in a different order.

---

## 🌟 Solution 1: Sorting-Based Approach  

### Approach:  
1. 🔡 Sort both strings `s` and `t`.  
2. ✅ Compare the sorted versions of `s` and `t`.  
   - If they are identical, `t` is an anagram of `s`.  
3. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), due to sorting.  

### ✨ Python Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Sort both strings and compare
        sorted_s = sorted(s)
        sorted_t = sorted(t)
        return sorted_s == sorted_t
```

## 🌟 Solution 2: Frequency Count Using `defaultdict`

### Approach:  
1. 📏 Check if the lengths of s and t are different:
    - If so, return False.
2. 📊 Count the frequency of characters in s using a defaultdict.
3. 🔄 Decrement the count for each character in t.
4. ✅ Verify if all counts in the dictionary are zero. 
4. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we traverse both strings once.  

### ✨ Python Implementation:  

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        # Count the frequency of characters in string s
        for x in s:
            count[x] += 1
        # Decrement the frequency of characters in string t
        for x in t:
            count[x] -= 1
        # Check if any character has non-zero frequency
        for val in count.values():
            if val != 0:
                return False
        return True
```
