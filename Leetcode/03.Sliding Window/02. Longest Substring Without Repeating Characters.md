# 📝 [Problem #3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)  

**🎯 Task**:  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  

---

## 🌟 Solution: Sliding Window  

### Approach:  
1. 🟢 **Initialize a set**: Use a set `v` to store characters in the current window (substring) without duplicates.  
2. ⚡ **Expand and shrink the window**:  
   - Use `l` as the left pointer and `r` as the right pointer to define the sliding window.  
   - Traverse the string with the right pointer `r`.  
   - If a character `c` is already in the set `v` (duplicate found), shrink the window by removing characters from the left pointer `l` until the duplicate is removed.  
   - Add the current characters to the set
3. 🎯 **Update the result**: After adding the current character to the set, calculate the length of the current window (`r - l + 1`) and update the maximum length `mx`.  
4. ✅ **Return the result**: At the end of traversal, return `mx` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.  
5. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string, as each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        v = set()  # Set to store characters in the current window
        l = 0      # Left pointer of the window
        mx = 0     # Maximum length of substring without repeating characters
        
        for r, c in enumerate(s):  # Traverse the string with the right pointer
            while c in v:          # If duplicate found, shrink the window
                v.remove(s[l])     # Remove character at the left pointer
                l += 1             # Move the left pointer forward
            v.add(c)               # Add the current character to the set
            mx = max(mx, r - l + 1)  # Update the maximum length
        return mx
