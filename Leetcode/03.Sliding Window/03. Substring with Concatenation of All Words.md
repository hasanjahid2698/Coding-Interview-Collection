# 📝 [Problem #30: Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/)  

**🎯 Task**:  
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`.  
- All the strings in `words` are of the same length.  
- Find all starting indices of concatenated substrings in `s` that contain all strings from `words` (in any order).  
- Return the indices in any order.

## 🌟 Solution: Sliding Window with Hashmap  

### Approach:  
1. 🟢 **Calculate key variables**:  
   - `ln`: Length of each word in `words`.  
   - `totalcount`: Total length of all words combined.  
2. ⚡ **Iterate over possible starting points**:  
   - For each possible starting index `i` in `s`, where there is enough remaining length for a concatenated substring.  
3. 🟦 **Track remaining words**:  
   - Use a dictionary `d` to track the count of remaining words needed to complete a valid concatenation.  
4. 🔁 **Check substrings**:  
   - Slide a window of size `ln` across the string starting at `i`.  
   - If the current substring matches a word in `d`, decrement its count in `d`.  
   - If all words are matched (`d` becomes empty), add `i` to the result list.  
   - Break if a mismatch occurs.  
5. ✅ **Return the result**: After iterating over all valid starting indices, return the result list.  
6. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(m\) is the total length of all words.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []  # To store starting indices of valid substrings
        ln = len(words[0])  # Length of each word
        totalcount = len(words) * ln  # Total length of concatenated words
        
        for i in range(len(s) - totalcount + 1):  # Iterate over all starting indices
            d = {}
            # Initialize the count dictionary for words
            for word in words:
                d[word] = d.get(word, 0) + 1
            
            # Check substring starting at i
            for j in range(i, i + totalcount, ln):
                ns = s[j:j + ln]  # Extract substring of length `ln`
                if ns in d:
                    d[ns] -= 1
                    if d[ns] == 0:
                        del d[ns]
                    if not d:  # If all words are matched
                        ans.append(i)
                        break
                else:
                    break        
        return ans
