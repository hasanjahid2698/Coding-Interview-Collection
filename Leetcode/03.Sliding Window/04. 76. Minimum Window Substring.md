# 📝 [Problem #76: Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)  

**🎯 Task**:  
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all the characters of `t` (including duplicates).  
If no such substring exists, return an empty string `""`.

## 🌟 Solution: Sliding Window with Two Hashmaps  

### Approach:  
1. 🟢 **Initialize frequency maps**:  
   - `twindow`: Frequency map for all characters in `t`.  
   - `swindow`: Frequency map for the current sliding window in `s`.  
2. 🟦 **Track progress**:  
   - `have`: Number of characters from `t` that meet the required count in the current window.  
   - `need`: Total distinct characters in `t` to be matched.  
3. 🔁 **Expand window**:  
   - Iterate over `s` with a right pointer `r`.  
   - Add the current character to `swindow` and update `have` if it meets the count in `twindow`.  
4. 🔄 **Shrink window**:  
   - Once all characters are matched (`have == need`), try to shrink the window by moving the left pointer `l`.  
   - Update the result if the current window size is smaller than the previously found minimum.  
5. ✅ **Return result**:  
   - Use the indices stored in `anss` to return the smallest valid substring.  
6. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of `s` and `t`, respectively.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # Initialize the frequency map for `t`
        swindow, twindow = {}, {}
        for c in t:
            twindow[c] = 1 + twindow.get(c, 0)
        
        # Variables to track the sliding window
        have, need = 0, len(twindow)
        ans = float('inf')
        anss = [-1, -1]
        l = 0

        # Expand the window
        for r in range(len(s)):
            c = s[r]
            swindow[c] = 1 + swindow.get(c, 0)

            if c in twindow and swindow[c] == twindow[c]:
                have += 1

            # Shrink the window
            while have == need:
                if r - l + 1 < ans:
                    anss = [l, r]
                    ans = r - l + 1
                
                swindow[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in twindow and swindow[s[l]] < twindow[s[l]]:
                    have -= 1
                l += 1
        
        # Return the minimum window substring
        l, r = anss
        return s[l:r+1] if ans != float('inf') else ""
