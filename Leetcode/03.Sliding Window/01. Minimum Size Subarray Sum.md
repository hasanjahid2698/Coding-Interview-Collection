# 📝 [Problem #209: Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/)  

**🎯 Task**:  
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.  

---

## 🌟 Solution: Sliding Window  

1. ⚡ **Check the sum**:
   - If the total sum of `nums` is less than `target`, immediately return `0`.  
2. 🟢 **Initialize variables**:
   - Use `l` as the left pointer, `s` as the current window sum, and `ans` as the result initialized to the maximum possible subarray length.  
3. 🔁 **Expand and shrink the window**:
   - Iterate through the array with the right pointer `r`, adding the value at `nums[r]` to the window sum `s`.  
   - Shrink the window by moving the left pointer `l` while `s` is greater than or equal to `target`. Update `ans` to the minimum length of the current subarray.  
4. ✅ **Return the result**:
   - If no valid subarray is found, return `0`. Otherwise, return `ans`.  
5. ⏱️ **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array, as each element is visited at most twice.

### ✨ Implementation:  

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(nums) < target:  # Check if the entire array's sum is less than the target
            return 0

        s, l, ans = 0, 0, len(nums)  # Initialize the window sum, left pointer, and answer
        
        for r, val in enumerate(nums):  # Iterate through the array with the right pointer
            s += val  # Expand the window by adding the current value
            while s >= target:  # Shrink the window while the sum is sufficient
                ans = min(ans, r - l + 1)  # Update the minimal length
                s -= nums[l]  # Remove the leftmost element from the window
                l += 1  # Move the left pointer forward
        
        return ans
