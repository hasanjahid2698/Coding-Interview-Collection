# ✨ Sliding Window Approach  
In the Sliding Window approach:

1. 🟢 Start with a window defined by two pointers, typically start and end (or left and right).
2. ⚡At each step:
    - 🔍 Expand or shrink the window:
        - ➡️ Move the end pointer to expand the window.
        - ⬅️ Move the start pointer to shrink the window if the condition is not satisfied.
    - 🎯 Check the current window for the desired property (e.g., sum, distinct elements, etc.).
3. 🔁 Continue adjusting the window dynamically based on the problem's requirements.
4. 📝 Keep track of the results (e.g., maximum/minimum size, sum, etc.) during the traversal.
1. ⏱️ Time Complexity: Typically O(n) for linear traversal.
    - each element is visited at most twice (once by start and once by end).
